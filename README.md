# Technical Blogging

Technical blogging will be a part of your journey here. Though time consuming and, sometimes, anxiety-inducing, writing as you learn will benefit you in so many ways:
  1. Your words are your world. Your mental models are only as strong as the words that you have to describe them. For this reason, we know that writing is often the best way to solidify our understanding of something new.
  2. We have an obligation to give back to the communities that helped us get to where we are today. You have benefited from the articles of so many other learners. This is your opportunity to help others who may be strugggling to grasp a concept that you have mastered! 
  3. You are building your brand. Succeeding as a developer is about more than your own ability to solve problems. You want to show future employers and teammates that you are a strong communicator with the capacity to help others solve problems as well.

#### Choosing a Topic
You a free to choose any topic from the previous unit to teach and/or explore further. Here are a few suggestions to guide your decision. 
  1. **Choose a topic that you still may be struggling with.** Part of this process is research and exploration. As you search for answers for your readers, you will inevitably grow in your own understanding.
  2. **Choose a topic to dive deeper on.** Is there a concept or feature that you understand in practice but are curious about _how_ it's working beneath the hood? That would make a great blog post!
  3. **Illuminate a problem solving pattern.** Have you found yourself coming back to a similar pattern to solve problems in this unit's problem sets? Have you come up with a unique solution to a problem that you think you may be able to re-use in the future? Give it a name and write about it! Show some examples of this in practice.

#### Guidelines
1. There are no firm word limits on your blog post but they should be **at least 500 words.**
2. No matter the topic, be sure to illustrate it with code snippets.
3. Your blog post should have a descriptive and compelling title.
4. It should include an introduction that states the purpose of your article and a summary that provides a recap.
5. If diagrams or pictures help convey your point, include them and be sure to attribute it to its author.
6. **Ensure your article is typo and grammar error free!** Write it in a word processor before transferring it to a markdown file. You can also run it through Grammarly.
7. Research, research, research! This is your opportunity to fall down the rabbit holes and stay there for a while. Your goal is to understand your article topic at least one level of abstraction below what you are teaching. If you are writing about hoisting, tell us what is happening during the compilation process. If you are diving into pass-by-reference/value in JavaScript, tell us what's going on at the level of memory management. Let your curiosity run!
